## 🏢 Layered Architecture and Netlink Sockets

- **Layers Focused**: Mainly revolves around the **Application layer** and the **Kernel layer**.

## 🛰 Socket Interface in Linux

- **Definition** 📚: A suite of system calls made available by the Linux kernel to facilitate socket-based communication.
  
- **Key APIs**: Such as `socket`, `accept`, `bind`, `send`, `receive`, `close`, and more.

## 🌌 Types of Communications through Socket Interface

1. **Network Socket-Based Communication**: Geared towards communication with remote entities on a network.
2. **Unix Domain Sockets**: Ideal for setting up communication between applications on the same system.
3. **Netlink Sockets**: Tailored for communication with kernel subsystems.

## 💡 Netlink Sockets: A Deeper Look

- **Functionality**: Acts as a unified medium for applications to liaise with various kernel subsystems.

## ❓ Interview Questions on Netlink Sockets
